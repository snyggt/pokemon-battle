# Pok√©mon Battle Simulator

## Planning

This is a coding challenge described in [challenge.md](/docs/challenge.md)

- Read about the planned structure of this repository here in [structure.md](/docs/structure.md)
- My interpretations of the challenge is documented in [specification.md](/docs/specification.md)

## Get started

### Clone

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:snyggt/pokemon-battle.git && \
cd pokemon-battle
```

### Install

Install all dependencies needed for the project, make sure you are standing in the root folder

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run tests

Run tests in all workspaces. Good for verifying, but it outputs a collapsed summery of all tests

```bash
pnpm run test
```

To get a better overview over the test cases; run tests for each workspace

for `modules/domain` worspace:

```bash
pnpm run test:domain
```

for `modules/app` worspace:

```bash
pnpm run test:app
```

for `modules/infra` worspace:

```bash
pnpm run test:infra
```

for `services/rest-api` worspace:

```bash
pnpm run test:api
```

### Run lint

Run lint check in all workspaces.

for `services/rest-api` worspace:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

### Start dev environment

To start all dev environments, (at this point there is only one service `services/rest-api`)

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Try out the endpoint by sending a http request

`POST: /api/v1/battle`

Curl example:
**Create Battle Simulation**: Replace awayTeam.pokemons and homeTeam.pokemons numbers with anything between 1 - 151 to simulate diffrent battles.

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:3000/api/v1/battle' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "awayTeam": {
        "pokemons": [
            1,
            66,
            77
        ],
        "trainerName": "Erik"
    },
    "homeTeam": {
        "pokemons": [
            44,
            33,
            2
        ],
        "trainerName": "Johan"
    },
    "simulate":true
}'
```

**Get all pokemons**

Get all 151 pokemons, use the pokedexId as id for creating new battle simulations
```bash
curl --location 'localhost:3000/api/v1/pokemon' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

```

Simple backlog to keep track of the project progress
