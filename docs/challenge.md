# Pokémon Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pokémon Coding Challenge! In this challenge, you will be working with a dataset of Pokémon, each represented as a JSON object with various properties.

## Problem

Develop a Pokémon battle simulator where users can simulate battles between two teams of Pokémon. The simulator should consider various properties in the dataset to determine the outcome of the battle. It is not important what factors are considered, and you do not need any previous knowledge of Pokémon to complete this test. Choose the factors that seem best for you to show oG your solution.

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from [pokedex.json](/doc/sample-data/pokedex.json).

## Tasks

• Create an API that simulates a Pokémon battle between two teams of Pokémon
• Use factors such as type electiveness, statistics (weight, height, multipliers), to determine the winning team.
• Should return a detailed battle log showing the flow of the battle
• The battle logic in this simulator does not need to reflect the outcomes or mechanics from the oGicial Pokémon games. Feel free to create your own system for determining the winner based on the dataset and relevant factors.

## Requirements

• Your application should be written in Node.js & Typescript.
• Your code should be organized and easy to read.
• You should handle any potential errors that could occur.
• The README should contain all instructions required to setup and run your program.

## Nice to have

• Load the dataset into a NoSQL database
• Validate parameters to API endpoint
• Dockerize the application
• Client to consume the API (React, Swagger, etc.)

## Submission

The expected time frame for this home assignment is around 5 hours, please document in the README if there were time constraints limiting your work and what you would’ve done if you’d had more time. Feel free to spend more time on the assignment if you like to.

Please submit your completed application by providing a link to a Git repository containing your code. Include any necessary instructions for running your application in a README file.
Good luck!
